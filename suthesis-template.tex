% basically this is a template file, you should be able to take it and
% start running.

% the philosophy behind this template is that each chapter or
% chapterlike section goes in a separate file and you use the \include
% command to input it into the final document.  The \includeonly
% command can be used so you only need to work on one or two chapters at a
% time (instead of having to either latex the entire book each time or
% losing cross-references and page numbering)

% copy this file and call it something like mythesis.tex

\documentclass[12pt]{report}
% note that the documentclass can take other option such as
% twoside - for double sided printing
% openright - if double side  chapters always start on odd pages
% openany - if double side chapters start on the next page even or odd
% 12pt can be replaced by 11pt

\usepackage{suthesis-2e}

%% load other packages you need

%% uncomment the following and create mythesis-macros.sty for all your
%% own macros.  This keeps this top level file looking fairly neat.
% \usepackage{mythesis-macros}

%% certain types of theses require special title page format.  See the
%% style file for the full list.  An example would be that for some of
%% the language departments. 
% \dualthesis \dept{Asian Languages} \languagemajor{Korean} 
%% or education
% \educationthesis

    \title{}
    \author{}
%\dept{} % default is Computer Science, uncomment for other departments
    \principaladviser{}
% \coprincipaladvisor{}
    \firstreader{}
    \secondreader{}
% \thirdreader{}

%the following command would (if uncommented) allow  only chapter1 and
%chapter2 to be processed
%\includeonly{chapter1,chapter2}

% if you feel real savvy use
% \typein{Now put in includeonly}
% the \typein command stops latex at this point and allows you to type
% in a command such as
% \includeonly{chapter3,chapter5}
% this can save some time and means you don't have to edit this file
% as much.


\begin{document}



% first the preface sections.  

% this includes the file preface.tex which should include the
% following commands
% \beforepreface
% \prefacesection{preface}
% body of the preface
\include{preface}

% any other preface sections

% the last preface section (e.g., acknowledgement.tex)
% should look like
% \prefacesection{Acknowledgement}
% body 
% \afterpreface
\include{acknowledgement}


% now for the body of the thesis, modify the number of these lines as needed

% this includes chapter1.tex which should start with a \chapter{...}
% command 
\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}
\include{chapter3}
\include{chapter4}
\include{chapter5}

% and the end material

\appendix

\include{appendix1}
\include{appendix2}
\include{appendix3}


% bibliography.tex should include either 
% \bibliographystyle{...}
% \bibliography{mythesis}
% or some other way of doing the bibliography
\include{bibliography}

\end{document}
